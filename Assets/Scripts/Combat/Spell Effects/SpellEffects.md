# Spell Effects Module

Really the only reason I want this to be it's own module is so we can't communicate
to the spells directly

I'm also not sure what the best name of this should be, but I named it Effects
because we can't name it Projectils as the Ice Wall isn't really a projectile
nor is whatever the lightning jump spawns
